## 📝 Overview

**EventLotteryApp** is an Android application built with **Java** and **Firebase Firestore**, designed to make registration for high-demand community events **fair**, **efficient**, and **accessible**.

Instead of forcing users to race to register the moment an event opens, entrants join a **waiting list** during a registration window. When the window closes, a **lottery system** randomly selects participants, notifies them, and fills cancelled spots with replacement entrants.

This ensures **equal opportunity** for people with work, accessibility, or schedule limitations.
